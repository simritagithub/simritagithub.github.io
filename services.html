                <a href="https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/early-access-read-along/" target="_blank">Read Along</a> has been designed to improve reading fluency and reading comprehension in children.

The ID is organised around universal principles on langauge learning and is informed by how children learn to read.

              <p>
                 <a href="https://treccprogram.org/en/project/palec/" target="_blank">PALEC</a> (Projet d’Amélioration de la Lecture-Ecriture et du Calcul) was introduced in Ivory Coast, West Africa, to bring about pedagogical changes focused on improving learning outcomes in early grades. Partnering with TRECC (Transforming Education in Cocoa Communities) which has been in operation since 2015, schools were set up in cocoa communities which followed the multi-grade-multi-level pedagogy. I was part of the curriculum and pedagogical team from TIDE Learning which ideated, designed, implemented, and monitored the academic side of the programme in 5 cocoa plantations along with Ivory Coast's education department.

They have implemented the muti- dimensional- multi- level (MDML) pedagogy in Andhra Pradesh, Goa and Ivory Coast, West Africa. As part of my work, I was responsilble for setting the curriculum framework from K to 5, across domains and disciplines, and lead a team of subject experts on designing pedagogical practices that aligned themselves to the MDML philosophy.

                I designed a history programme for middle schoolers at <a href=" https://farmhill-learning.org/" target="_blank">Farmhill Learning Community</a>. At Farmhill, learning moves beyond traditional and conventional frameworks of fixed and time bound syllabi. Centred around doing and nature, learning is seen as continuous and inter-connected. Our history sessions focussed not on acquiring content knowledge as much as on developing skills such as researching, asking the right questions, analysing historical sources, evaluating and presenting well-formed arguments.

I designed a gap analysis framework to review the app to identify its strengths and weaknesses. As part of this, data was collected from the field, and analysed against a theoretical framework derived from universally accepted principles on reading and how children learn to read. I used an exploratory and descriptive methodology to analyse the interviews of various stakeholders, and the content on the app. The gap analysis report covered what was found, and recommendations to help achieve its goal of reading fluency.
