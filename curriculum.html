Curriculum Approach & Instructional Design</h3>

  <p>
Developing instructional design and curriculum frameworks for foundational stage and primary grades for all domains of development and disciplines.

              <div class="subheading mb-3">Google Read Along</div>
              <p>
                Read Along has been designed to improve reading fluency and reading comprehension in children. After reviewing and analysing the app against a comprehensive and balanced theoretical approach to language learning, I designed an ID to help Google Read Along achieve foundational literacy goals which are part of the NIPUN Bharat Mission. The ID is organised around universal principles on langauge learning and is informed by how children learn to read.

PALEC Programme in Ivory Coast</div>
              <p>
               PALEC (Projet d’Amélioration de la Lecture-Ecriture et du Calcul) was introduced in Ivory Coast, West Africa, to bring about pedagogical changes focused on improving learning outcomes in early grades. Partnering with TRECC (Transforming Education in Cocoa Communities) which has been in operation since 2015, schools were set up in cocoa communities which followed the multi-grade-multi-level pedagogy. I was part of the curriculum and pedagogical team from TIDE Learning which ideated, designed, implemented, and monitored the academic side of the programme in 5 cocoa plantations along with Ivory Coast's education department.

TIDE Learning</div>
              <p>
              I set up and led the academic team at TIDE Learning, a for profit educational company, that works on making quality learning accessible, affordable & sustainable. They have implemented the muti- dimensional- multi- level (MDML) pedagogy in Andhra Pradesh, Goa and Ivory Coast, West Africa. As part of my work, I was responsilble for setting the curriculum framework from K to 5, across domains and disciplines, and lead a team of subject experts on designing pedagogical practices that aligned themselves to the MDML philosophy.

Farmhill Learning Community</div>
              <p>
             I designed a history programme for middle schoolers at Farmhill Learning Community. At Farmhill, learning moves beyond traditional and conventional frameworks of fixed and time bound syllabi. Centred around doing and nature, learning is seen as continuous and inter-connected. Our history sessions focussed not on acquiring content knowledge as much as on developing skills such as researching, asking the right questions, analysing historical sources, evaluating and presenting well-formed arguments.
